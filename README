This is a simple ssh obfuscating proxy -- it xors every byte of SSH traffic 
with 0x19. This is enough to defeat DPI systems that try to look at the SSH
handshake / version string to identify SSH traffic. Unlike existing code that
obfuscates SSH traffic, this doesn't require root access or patching the SSH 
codebase.

The code in chunkssh.pl is not mine -- it's Brian Hatch's, and I used some of 
their code to avoid reimplementing the annoying bits like forking and opening
sockets. See http://insecure.org/stc/sti.html for the original copy of 
chunkssh.pl (you need to search for "chunkssh.pl", it's about halfway through 
the page).

It's possible to use other DPI methods to block SSH traffic xored with 0x19 --
the easiest way to do so is to look at packet sizes. If you want more advanced
obfuscation, just use Tor's obfsproxy: https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
