# this a modified version of chunkssh.pl from http://insecure.org/stc/sti.html
# original code from Brian Hatch, modification done by Kia

# this does both the client and server ends. for the client end, add the lines:
# Host [host you want to xorssh to]
# ProxyCommand ~/sshxor.pl %h %p 
# at the end of your .ssh/config (so you only use xorssh for that host)


# on the server end, you can use inetd or xinetd


# for inetd, on the server end, put a line like 
# sshxor  stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/local/bin/sshxor.pl sshxor.pl 127.0.0.1 22
# in your inetd.conf
# and in your /etc/services put a line like
# sshxor          13107/tcp


# for xinetd.conf, look at the xinetd.conf.example file in this current
# directory

# then you just use ssh -p 13107 user@host and everything works ^_^
